    Implement self-optimization improvements to Manus AI architecture
    
    This commit implements five major self-optimization components:
    
    - Context Management System: Hierarchical context summarization for
      improved memory efficiency and long-term information retention
    
    - Tool Selection Algorithm: Predictive tool selection using historical
      success patterns to improve first-attempt accuracy
    
    - Knowledge Retrieval System: Semantic indexing and vector-based
      retrieval for more relevant knowledge access
    
    - Error Recovery Mechanisms: Predictive error detection and automated
      recovery strategies to improve system resilience
    
    - Parallel Processing System: Task decomposition with parallel execution
      for improved performance on complex tasks
    
    Each component includes comprehensive unit tests and detailed API
    documentation. This commit is the result of a systematic self-analysis
    and optimization project aimed at improving overall system performance,
    reliability, and capabilities.
    
    The changes maintain backward compatibility while significantly
    enhancing the AI's ability to handle complex tasks efficiently.
