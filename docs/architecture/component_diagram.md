## Component Interactions

1. **Event Stream** serves as the central communication channel, receiving and distributing events to all components.

2. **User Interface** handles all interactions with the user, receiving messages and sending responses.

3. **Agent Loop Controller** manages the overall execution flow, determining when to process events, select tools, and deliver results.

4. **Core Processing** contains the primary intelligence components:
   - Planning Module: Creates and updates task plans
   - Knowledge Module: Provides contextual information and best practices
   - Datasource Module: Retrieves external data

5. **Tool Selection & Execution** determines which tools to use based on the current context and manages their execution.

6. **Natural Language Processing** handles understanding user input and generating appropriate responses.

7. **External Tools Interface** provides access to various external capabilities:
   - Shell Execution: Runs commands in the operating system
   - Browser Interaction: Navigates and extracts web content
   - Deployment System: Deploys applications and services

8. **Content Generation** handles creating and managing content:
   - File Handling: Reads, writes, and manipulates files
   - Message Creation: Formats messages to users
   - Writing System: Generates structured content following rules
